CODE CLEANING FOR PUBLISHING => REQUIRED FILES FOR GIT REPO

* SCRIPTS

* DATA
. PUT ONLY MANOIM AVERAGE RESPONSE DATA INTO THE REPO UNDER DATA FOLDER! DONE
  Model related folder is NOT required since it is generated by the scripts i.e. you need to run the script once.
  One problem is model activity dists folder, which takes a while to generate (5000 instances). Yet the file is also 200 MB so forget pushing to git xD

* FIGURES to check:
 - DONE Figure 1: fitting procedure -> b from fit_rate_model_to_data.py,
                                       c from plot_valences_normalized_mbon.py
 - DONE Figure S2: Many many things xD -> a from plot_correlation_different_overlaps.py,
                                          b-d from inter_odor_activity_correlation_sparseness.py,
                                          e from plot_valences_normalized_mbon.py,
                                          f-g from fit_rate_model_to_data.py,
                                          h from learning_rate_screening_mbon_normalized.py
 - DONE Figure S4: Activity distributions for model variants -> e from rate_model_odor_stimulation_activity_histograms.py

TODOs GENERAL:
 - Folder hierarchy: 3 different folders -> codes, data and figures, figures is in gitignore all together so you do not push anything. DONE
 - GET RID OF THE DATAFRAME GENERATION for the supplementary data. They are in many scripts generating figures. DONE

 - Function scripts -> MAKE SURE THERE IS NO UNNECESSARY FUNCTION WHICH IS NOT USED
    DONE following scripts:
     . fit_functions.py
     . KC_population_calcium_rate_model_functions.py

 - CLEAN ALL SCRIPTS GE RID OF DUMB COMMENTS AND MAKE SURE NAMING IS RIGHT IN FUNCTIONS ETC
    Following scripts:
     . fit_functions.py DONE
     . fit_rate_model_to_data.py DONE
     . inter_odor_activity_correlation_sparseness.py DONE
     . KC_population_calcium_rate_model_functions.py => RENAMING AND REORGANIZING SOME FUNCTIONS since there are residual stuff here & there. DONE
     . learning_rate_screening_mbon_normalized.py DONE
     . plot_correlation_different_overlaps.py DONE
     . plot_valences_normalized_mbon.py DONE
     . plotting_related_functions.py DONE
     . rate_model_get_summed_KC_activity_different_model_variants.py DONE
     . rate_model_odor_stimulation_activity_histograms.py DONE

 - MAKE SURE L1 NORM FACTOR IS CORRECTLY CHANGED FROM 0.015 TO WHATEVER IT IS NOW DONE

 - FROM ALL SCRIPTS REMOVE the time stamp and author name! DONE

 - RUN ALL NEW SCRIPTS TO MAKE SURE THEY WORK
    Following scripts:
     . fit_rate_model_to_data.py DONE
     . inter_odor_activity_correlation_sparseness.py DONE BUT QUNATITIATIVE DIFFERENCE in the figures due to rng, which should not really mattter.
     . learning_rate_screening_mbon_normalized.py DONE AGAIN RNG-RELATED DIFFERENCE IN THE FIGURES,
                                                  but nothing really important for the story all together.
     . plot_correlation_different_overlaps.py DONE BUT QUNATITIATIVE DIFFERENCE in the figures due to rng (as in the previous overlap figure),
                                              causing smaller r^2 values.
     . plot_valences_normalized_mbon.py DONE
     . rate_model_get_summed_KC_activity_different_model_variants.py DONE
     . rate_model_odor_stimulation_activity_histograms.py DONE

 - GET RID OF SAVEPARAMS AND PLOT HANDLES, GENERATE FIGURES AND EVERYTHING AS SOON AS YOU RUN THE CODE! DONE

 - READJUST THE SAVE AND LOAD DIRECTORIES -> USUALLY ONE FILE LOWER THAN WHAT YOU HAVE! DONE

 - FIGURE SAVE DIRECTORY (FSD) is SIMPLY FIGURES/ NOW NO SUB-FOLDERING SINCE YOU SAVE ONLY THE FIGURES IN THE MS WITH THE RESPECTIVE NAME TAG!

 - DELETE / TRANSPORT THIS FILE TO SOMEWHERE ELSE WE DO NOT WANT IT IN THE REPO TODO

 - WRITE README FOR THE REPO TODO

NOTES SCRIPTS:

* You need to FIRST RUN fit_rate_model_to_data.py to get the data for the model fitting, then you can run the rest of the scripts.
* For ANY learning - related script you additionally need to run FIRST rate_model_get_summed_KC_activity_different_model_variants.py
  to be able to TUNE MBON activity for the given set of parameters.
* plot_valences_normalized_mbon.py should be RUN ONLY AFTER RUNNING learning_rate_screening_mbon_normalized.py
  since it uses the data generated by the latter script.
